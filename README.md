## problem statement
The dataset includes descriptions of hypothetical samples corresponding to 23 species of gilled mushrooms in the Agaricus and Lepiota Family Mushroom drawn from The Audubon Society Field Guide to North American Mushrooms (1981). Each species is identified as definitely edible, definitely poisonous, or of unknown edibility and not recommended. This latter class was combined with the poisonous one. The aim of this problem is to identify the poisonous and edible class. 
Data has been predicted through RandomForestClassifier from sklearn.ensemble in python.
Accuracy has been calculated by splitting the data from mushroom_train csv file.
To calculalte accuracy on mushroom_test csv data uncomment few lines in code.
